options are too low or just worse.


2. rejecting the null hypothesis of original data means that the two groups are different. However, there is not T-Test assumptions. Thus,
 it may not be accurate.
For  the transformed data it means that the groups are different, and the results follow the T-Test assumptions.
Thus, it is more accurate.

3. The weekly seems like the best option. It smooths out the data from high to low. It also shows a big difference making it easier
for us to understand. The p values and variance also make sense. It also groups the data making it more realistic and accurate. Thus, it is the best option.


4. One way to tell when the most comments were posted is by calculating the average. Thus, I used the mean function on the weekend
and weekdays to comapare the results. The results reveal that there were more reddit comments on the weekends compared to week days.
